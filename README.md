# PDS DOS Compatibility Card Extender

This repo includes the original PDS DOS Compatibility Card Extender made by tomytronics on reddit called Replacement Extender Card for Apple DOS Compatibility v 1.0.

It was inspired by the original Reply  Extender Card.

This allows you to use the Houdini I and Houdini II PDS DOS Compatibility cards in computers like the Macintosh Quadra 700 and Macintosh Quadra 950.

### Notes from tomytronics for his design

"My original design fits perfectly but is prone to interference without wrapping them in foil and connecting them to ground screws."

"You are free to upload the original and modified files anywhere. The only important part to know is to keep the boardâ€™s width, the location of the connector on the DOS card side, and the 4 holes unchanged. The  connector on the other side should be the same to use the same bracket  off the Reply DOS cards or you could change it to break out game port  and VGA port rather than to rely on hard to find cable."

### Future Plans

I will be modifying tomytronics' original design to fix the interference issues. I will also add a 3.5mm headphone jack. There will probably be two or 3 versions of the extender. One will have the original HD-26 connect
